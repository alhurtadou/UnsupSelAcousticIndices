The files pr1.py, pr2.py and pr3.py are modified versions of main_test_indices.py from Guyot and Eldridge repository (https://github.com/patriceguyot/Acoustic_Indices/). These files process, in parallel, the wav files of the Yataros1, Yataros2 and Yataros3 datasets in order to compute their acoustic indices. The Python codes load, from a path, all the wav audios available at http://colecciones.humboldt.org.co/rec/sonidos/publicaciones/MAP/JDT-Yataros/. You should change the content of the variable dir_path according to your local folder name. Notice that the option  Loader=yaml.FullLoader was changed by  Loader=yaml.loader.Loader due to compatibility with python 3.12.2 version. The characterized resulting datasets are saved in csv files whose headers were removed manually for the subsequent processing.
